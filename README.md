# t-SNE
 t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to represent high-dimensional dataset in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions so that we can visualize it. It embeds the points from a higher dimension to a lower dimension trying to preserve the neighborhood of that point.
